# Next.js Conflicting Peer Dependencies

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered in Next.js applications involving conflicting peer dependencies.  The application uses a package with peer dependencies that clash with the project's existing dependencies. This leads to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

You will likely observe an error message related to conflicting peer dependencies.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully managing dependencies, potentially utilizing techniques like `resolutions` in your `package.json` to specify which versions of conflicting packages to use, or opting for alternative libraries that have better compatibility.
